## Information

#### About
SpiderSense is my own personal fork/contiunation of the GameSense client player assistance utility mod for Minecraft. The original clent was discontiuned in May of 2021. I have decided to make it a project to update and add new features to GameSense, because it was a really promising client, and I can't wait to see it developed to it's true potential.
